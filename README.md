## Frontend Tooling and React
an application that uses React along with cowsay and faker to create home page that updates state and renders to the DOM on click. 
  

###### App
* Contains the entire application's view and state
* Has a property on the state called content 
* Creates a view with the following display:
  * A heading with the title "Generate Cowsay Lorem"
  * A Button that displays "click me"
    * `onClick` the button should generate new content on the app state using cowsay and faker
  * A pre tag that displays the App state (content)
